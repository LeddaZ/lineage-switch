# DISCONTINUED

This project is abandoned. If you want to install Android on your Switch, follow the [official instructions](https://wiki.switchroot.org/wiki/android).

# lineage-switch
Unofficial LineageOS 17.1 and 18.1 builds (based on Android 10 and 11 respectively) for the Nintendo Switch. Official Switchroot builds are available here: [10](https://wiki.switchroot.org/en/Android/Setup-10), [11](https://wiki.switchroot.org/en/Android/Setup-11).

Builds are signed with my own keys, so a clean flash may be required if coming from/to official/other builds.

**Do NOT report any issues you encounter with my builds to the Switchroot team on Discord or other platforms. Only report them issues with their official builds, they can't do anything about unofficial releases.**

**No support will be provided for these builds, as they are for my personal usage. Flash at your own risk.**

```
* Disclaimer 
* I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, 
* or you getting fired because the alarm app failed. Please do some research 
* if you have any concerns about features included in this ROM
* before flashing it! YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if
* you blame me in any way for what happens to your device, I will laugh at you.
```

## Steps
- Download `nx-tab-{date}.7z` (standard Android) or `nx-atv-{date}.7z` (Android TV) from the [Releases](https://github.com/LeddaZ/lineage-switch/releases/latest) page. Hekate is included; files with the `-gms` suffix have MindTheGApps included.
- Extract the 7z file's contents to the SD card root.
- If you want root, download the latest version of [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases/latest). Flash it after the first boot.
- Follow the official instructions [here](https://wiki.switchroot.org/en/Android/Setup-11).

To update, download `lineage-18.1-{date}-UNOFFICIAL-nx_tab.zip` (standard Android) or `lineage-18.1-{date}-UNOFFICIAL-nx.zip` (Android TV) and flash it in recovery (files with the `-gms` suffix have MindTheGApps included). You can also update from Settings -> System -> Updater. **You can't update from a no-GMS build to a GMS build, you have to clean flash.** The updater will automatically download the correct build.
